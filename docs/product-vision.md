# DoppleCart – Product Vision

**Tagline:** Push a cart full of AI influencers.

DoppleCart is an AI-driven platform that lets users **create, manage, and orchestrate many artificial influencer personas at once.** Each persona is a digital “doppelgänger”: a synthetic influencer with a defined personality, style, tone, aesthetic, and content strategy.

The platform gives creators, marketers, and teams a unified command center for:
- Creating and customizing multiple AI personas
- Generating persona-consistent content (captions + images + ideas)
- Planning and scheduling posts across social platforms
- Managing high volumes of synthetic creators with minimal effort
- Learning what works through analytics, feedback loops, and recommendations

DoppleCart’s conceptual metaphor:
> A user pushing a cart overflowing with doppelgänger influencers — each one ready to publish content, grow an audience, and operate at scale.
